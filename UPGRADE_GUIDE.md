5. **Verification**: Confirms successful installation

### File Categories

- **Critical Files**: Always updated (core system, UI, features)

### Backup Management

Backups are stored in `musicplayer/backups/` with naming format:
```
v[version]_[date]_[time]
```

Examples:
- `v4.0_20231215_143022` - Version 4.0 backup from Dec 15, 2023 at 14:30:22

If critical files fail to update, the system offers automatic rollback to your previous version.

### Manual Rollback
You can manually restore any previous backup through the backup management menu.

### Error Handling
- Failed downloads are logged and reported
- Critical file failures trigger rollback prompts
- Network errors are handled gracefully

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
If you can't connect to the update server:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify ComputerCraft HTTP is enabled
3. Try again in a few minutes

### Failed Downloads
If files fail to download:
1. Check the upgrade logs for details
2. Try the upgrade again
3. Use rollback if needed

### Corrupted Installation
If the system becomes unstable:
1. Run `upgrade` and select backup management
2. Choose a recent backup to restore
3. Or reinstall using the original installer

## Advanced Usage

### Force Updates
The system allows force updates even when you're on the latest version. This is useful for:
- Reinstalling corrupted files
- Getting the latest fixes
- Testing purposes

### Selective Updates

### Log Analysis
Upgrade logs contain detailed information about:

## Version History

Each upgrade is logged with:
- Source version
- Target version
- Files updated
- Success/failure status
- Backup location
- Timestamp

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Backups**: The system creates automatic backups, but manual ones never hurt
2. **Test Upgrades**: Try upgrades in a test environment first if possible
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check upgrade logs for any warnings or errors
4. **Keep Backups**: Don't delete old backups unless space is limited
5. **Document Changes**: Note any custom modifications before upgrading

## Recovery Procedures

### Complete System Recovery
1. Run `upgrade`
2. Select "Manage backups and rollback"
3. Choose your most recent working backup
4. Confirm restoration

### Partial Recovery
If only some files are problematic:
1. Run `upgrade` with force update
2. Select only the problematic file categories
3. Let the system replace the corrupted files

### Emergency Recovery
If `upgrade` won't run:
1. Download the installer again
2. Run a fresh installation
3. Your logs and backups will be preserved

## Support
