## Network Radio Technical Details

The network radio system uses ComputerCraft's rednet API for communication:

- **Protocol**: `bognesferga_radio` for messages, `radio_station` for discovery
- **Synchronization**: Automatic time offset calculation for synchronized playback
- **Range**: Standard wireless modem range (64+ blocks, more at higher altitudes)
- **Compatibility**: Works with both wireless and ender modems

### Setting Up a Radio Network
1. Ensure all computers have wireless modems attached
2. All computers should be within wireless range of each other
3. One computer hosts a station, others can connect as clients
4. Multiple stations can operate simultaneously on the same network

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture:

```
startup.lua          # Main entry point and menu system
musicplayer/
â”œâ”€â”€ config.lua       # Configuration and constants
â”œâ”€â”€ state.lua        # Global state management
â”œâ”€â”€ ui.lua           # YouTube player UI rendering
â”œâ”€â”€ input.lua        # Mouse/keyboard input handling
â”œâ”€â”€ audio.lua        # Audio streaming and playback
â”œâ”€â”€ network.lua      # HTTP request/response handling
â”œâ”€â”€ main.lua         # YouTube player coordination
â”œâ”€â”€ menu.lua         # Main menu system
â”œâ”€â”€ radio.lua        # Network radio logic
â””â”€â”€ radio_ui.lua     # Radio interface rendering
```

## Troubleshooting
